Laravel Breeze
	Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Or, Breeze can scaffold your application using Vue or React and Inertia.

	Breeze provides a wonderful starting point for beginning a fresh Laravel application and is also a great choice for projects that plan to take their Blade templates to the next level with Laravel Livewire.

Laravel Jetstream
	While Laravel Breeze provides a simple and minimal starting point for building a Laravel application, Jetstream augments that functionality with more robust features and additional frontend technology stacks. For those brand new to Laravel, we recommend learning the ropes with Laravel Breeze before graduating to Laravel Jetstream.

	Jetstream provides a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management. Jetstream is designed using Tailwind CSS and offers your choice of Livewire or Inertia driven frontend scaffolding.

	Complete documentation for installing Laravel Jetstream can be found within the official Jetstream documentation.
