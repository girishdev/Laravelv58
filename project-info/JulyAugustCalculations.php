1st => 10,851 + 4,400 = 15,251

5th => 5,541 + 10,376 + 23,642 + 3,948 + 1,765 + 3,746 + 8,548 + 1,300 = 58,866

Ujjivan + Rajesh = 4,000 + 9,000 = 13,000

SBI Cc + RBL Cc = 12,000

15,251 + 58,866 + 13,000 + 12,000 = 99,117{99,500 Or 1,00,000}(Every Month Needed)
Or
96,000(Every Month Needed)

================================
14,00,000/12 = 1,16,666
=> 98,666(Deduction 18,000)
=> No Savings, Because I may take one more lone for 2 Months gap(Aug and Sept)

================================
16,00,000/12 = 1,33,333
=> 1,15,333(Deduction 18,000)
19,333(we will save)

Now => 19,333 {If it is 1L -> 15,000}
After 1 Year => 19,333 + 25,000 = 44,333
================================
18,00,000/12 = 1,50,000
=> 1,25,000(Deduction 25,000)
29,000(we will save)

Now => 29,000 {If it is 1L -> 25,000}
After 1 Year => 29,000 + 25,000 = 54,000
================================
20,00,000/12 = 1,66,666
=> 1,41,666(Deduction 25,000)
45,666(we will save)

Now => 45,666 {If it is 1L -> 41,000}
After 1 Year => 45,666 + 25,000 = 70,666
